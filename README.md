PDF Summarization Tool Using LangChain and Hugging Face
This project is a user-friendly PDF Summarization Tool that extracts text from PDF files and generates concise summaries using LangChain and Hugging Face API. Built with Streamlit, the tool provides a seamless interface for uploading PDFs and viewing their summarized content.

Features
PDF Text Extraction: Extracts text from uploaded PDF files using PyPDF2.
Text Summarization: Leverages pre-trained Hugging Face models (e.g., facebook/bart-large-cnn) for generating summaries.
Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for ease of use.
Error Handling: Handles corrupted or invalid PDFs gracefully.
API Integration: Uses Hugging Face API for LLM-based summarization.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
LangChain: For LLM integration and prompt management.
Hugging Face Hub: For accessing pre-trained models.
Streamlit: For building an interactive UI.
PyPDF2: For PDF text extraction.
Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-summarization-tool.git
cd pdf-summarization-tool
Install Dependencies:
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Hugging Face API Key:
Create a file named .streamlit/secrets.toml and add your Hugging Face API key:

toml
Copy
Edit
HF_API_KEY = "your_huggingface_api_key"
Run the Application:
Start the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Upload PDF and Summarize:
Access the app at http://localhost:8501, upload a PDF file, and view the summary.
